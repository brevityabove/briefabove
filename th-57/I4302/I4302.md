Straight-In/Circle-to-Land/Sidestep Minima
==========================================

AIM 5-4-5/5-4-20:

- Straight-in:
  - provided when FAC is within 30 degrees of runway alignment (15 degrees for
    GPS IAPs) and a normal descent can be made from the MDA or DH;
  - If either of the requirements above cannot be met, only circling minima will
    be provided.
- Circle-to-Land:
  - circling MDA provides 300 ft of obstacle clearance;
  - MDA only applies to protected circling area, which is dependent on aircraft
    approach category. TH-57 at 90 KIAS is CAT A with a circling radius of 1.3
    NM up to an MDA of 7000 ft MSL.
- Sidestep:
  - may be provided when parallel runways are 1200 ft or less apart
  - minima will normally be higher for the side-step runway

Option Approach
===============

AIM 4-3-22; GP:

- Your options if tower says "cleared for the option" are:
  - missed approach (don't technically need clearance for this if on an IAP);
  - low approach;
  - touch-and-go;
  - stop-and-go;
  - full stop.

- Pilot should request this passing the FAF inbound on an IAP or in the downwind
  on a VFR traffic pattern.
- Procedure is mostly used for training as it gives the instructor "options."
- Procedure will only be done at fields with an operating control tower.

HAA/HAT/HAL
===========

Pilot Controller Glossary; GP:

- HAA: height of the MDA above the published airport elevation. Used for all
  circling approach minima.
- HAT: height of the DH or MDA above the highest runway elevation in the
  touchdown zone (first 3,000 feet of the runway). Used for all straight-in
  minima.
- HAL: height above a designated helicopter landing area. Used for COPTER
  minima.
