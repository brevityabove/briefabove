AIM 4-3-22; GP:

- Your options if tower says "cleared for the option" are:
  - missed approach (don't technically need clearance for this if on an IAP);
  - low approach;
  - touch-and-go;
  - stop-and-go;
  - full stop.

- Pilot should request this passing the FAF inbound on an IAP or in the downwind
  on a VFR traffic pattern.
- Procedure is mostly used for training as it gives the instructor "options."
- Procedure will only be done at fields with an operating control tower.
