Dark Adaptation
===============

[FAA Airplane Flying Handbook Chapter 12][1]
- Avoid bright light (especially white).
- Takes at least 30 minutes for eyes to become fully adapted.
- Can lose adaptation in a few seconds on exposure to bright light.
- Eyeball anatomy:
  - Cones sense color and are concentrated in the center of the retina (fovea);
  - Rods sense light in black and white and surround the fovea;
  - Cones lose effectiveness under low light, however rods are still effective.
  - When fully adjusted to darkness, rods become 100,000 times more sensitive to
    light then they were under lighted conditions.

Night Hover Scan
================

Night Visual Scan Techniques
============================

[FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook Chapter 13][2]:

- Off-center viewing is used to focus on objects with rods.
- Short regularly spaced eye movements in 10 degree sectors.
- Scan from left to right or right to left starting at the greatest distance at
  which an object can be perceived and move inward toward the aircraft.

Vertigo
=======

TH-57 NATOPS 17.1:

- NOTE:
> Because of the inherent instability of helicopter flight, the possibility of
> vertigo caused by sideward motion or oscillation is a more prevalent hazard
> during night and instrument flight than it is in fixed-wing aircraft.

Use of lights
=============

RWOP 3.1.2; TH-57 NATOPS 7.7:

- General Operations: POSITION - ON 30 min before sunset until 30 min after
  sunrise. Anti-collision lights on from engine start to shutdown.
- NDZ Ops: Below flight idle: POSITION - FLASH/BRT. In the line: POSITION -
  STDY/BRT, ANTI-COLLISION - OFF. Crossing hold short: ANTI-COLLISION - ON,
  POSITION - STDY/BRT.
- Maintenance required: POSITION - FLASH/BRT.
- Taxiing through pits without refueling: SEARCHLIGHT - FLASH.
- Cleared under rotor arc: LDG LIGHT - FLASH.

CNAF 5.1.1.2:

- Anti-collision lights may be secured at anytime their use adversely affects
  ground operations, or anytime the aircraft is in the clouds.

VASI/PAPI
=========

VASI
----

AIM 2-1-2.a:

- For three bar systems, normal glide slope is 3 degrees and the upper glide
  slope is normally 1/4 degrees higher.
- Visible 3 - 5 mi during the day and up to 20 mi at night.
- Provides obstacle clearance within plus or minus 10 degrees of extended runway
  centerline up to 4 NM from runway threshold.
- Descent should not be initiated until aircraft is visually aligned with the
  runway.

PAPI
----

AIM 2-1-2.b:

- Visible 5 mi during the day and up to 20 mi at night.
- Provides obstacle clearance within plus or minus 10 degrees of extended runway
  centerline up to 4 SM from runway threshold.
- Descent should not be initiated until aircraft is visually aligned with the
  runway.

Helicopter Procedures at Night
==============================

Required equipment for night flight
-----------------------------------

TH-57 NATOPS 4.21:

1. All instrument and circuit breaker panel lights.
2. All exterior lights.
3. Operable communication radio.
4. Attitude gyro.
5. Radar altimeter.

Contact FTI Chapter 8:

Preflight/Taxiing for Takeoff
-----------------------------

- Same as day except will take longer.
- Use a white lensed flashlight due to hydraulic fluid and oil being colored.
- In addition to normal preflight, ensure the following are checked:
  - Exterior lights operational in all modes (e.g. position lights);
  - Landing light and search light (search light can be positioned);
  - All gauge and panel lighting with correct response to rheostat and
    bright/dim switch;
  - Cockpit lights;
  - Cleanliness of windows, especially front windscreen.

- Perform Instrument Checklist while taxiing for takeoff.

Vertical Takeoff/Landing
------------------------

- Shall be accomplished with search or landing light on.
- Pick reference points to the front and side prior to lifting due to lack of
  visual cues.
- Do not fixate on one point.

Landings (General)
------------------

- Use a specific group of lights to identify landing point.
- Search light or landing light shall be turned on by 200 ft AGL and remain on
  throughout landing evolution.
- If possible, all landings should be made to a hover to assess landing zone.
- Do not hesitate to waveoff if ground references are not acquired.

Hovering
--------

- Same technique as daytime with landing light on.
- Without aid of search light or landing light, anti-collision lights provide
  illumination.
  - Skid height can be determined by skid shadow size: larger shadow indicates
    further from ground.
- Reference points should be selected to front and side at varying distances.
- Avoid fixating on the runway centerline during takeoff to mitigate spacial
  disorientation.

Hover Taxi
----------

- All low work shall be conducted with the search or landing light on.
- Tendency is to hover too fast due to lack of visual cues.
- A reference must be made to the side to pick up taxi rate.
- If taxiing on a runway, runway lights and centerline provide good reference
  for rate.

Night Course Rules (South Whiting, Santa Rosa, Duke, Choctaw)
=============================================================

Emergency Procedures
====================

Contact FTI Chapter 809:

- Same as day except will normally take longer due to increase physiological
  stress and reduced vision.
- Know the location of everything in the cockpit to increase EP efficiency.
- Forced landings: use landing light and any power available to reduce descent
  rate to identify safe landing area.

Landing Site Evaluation at Night
================================

TH-57 NTAOPS 17.7.2; Contact FTI Chapter 810:

- Become familiar with the terrain you will be flying over.
- Use landing light to observe obstructions and select landing area.
- SWEEP checks:
  - (S) Size, slope, surface, suitability;
  - (W) Winds, loss of wind effect;
  - (E) Elevation (AGL, PA, DA);
  - (E) Egress route (including waveoff direction);
  - (P) Power (required vs. available).
