En-Route/Feeder Routes
======================

- feeder route:
  - provides transition from en route structure to appropriate IAF.
  - When cleared for the approach, the published off airway (feeder) routes that
    lead from the en route structure to the IAF **are** part of the approach
    clearance.
    
Minimum Safe Altitudes/Emergency Safe Altitudes
===============================================

MOCA/MCA/MRA
============

Pilot Controller Glossary; GP:

- MCA: lowest altitude at certain fixes at which an aircraft must cross when
  going from a lower to a higher MEA.

- MOCA: lowest altitude which ensures obstacle clearance for entire route
  segment and acceptable navigation coverage within 22 NM of a VOR.

- MRA: minimum altitude at which an intersection can be determined.
  - Note: this is usually based on not having DME capability.
