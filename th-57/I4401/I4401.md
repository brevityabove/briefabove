1. All instrument and circuit breaker panel lights.
2. All exterior lights.
3. Operable communication radio.
4. Attitude gyro.
5. radar altimeter.

En-Route/Feeder Routes
======================

AIM 5-4-6:

- feeder route:
  - provides transition from en route structure to appropriate IAF.
  - When cleared for the approach, the published off airway (feeder) routes that
    lead from the en route structure to the IAF **are** part of the approach
    clearance.
  - Unless otherwise instructed, once on the feeder route, the pilot may descent
    to the published altitude.

Minimum Safe Altitudes/Emergency Safe Altitudes
===============================================

Pilot Controller Glossary; GP:

- MSA:
  - used for emergency purposes and published on IAPs.
  - at least 1000 ft of obstacle clearance within a 25 mile radius of the
    nav facility, waypoint, or airport reference point used as the MSA center.
  - does not ensure acceptable navigation signal coverage.

- ESA:
  - used for emergency purposes, normally published only in military IAPs.
  - at least 1000' obstacle clearance in non-mountainous areas.
  - at least 2000' obstacle clearance in mountainous areas.
  - within 100 mile radius of nav facility or waypoint used as the ESA center.

MOCA/MCA/MRA
============

Pilot Controller Glossary; GP:

- MCA: lowest altitude at certain fixes at which an aircraft must cross when
  going from a lower to a higher MEA.

- MOCA: lowest altitude which ensures obstacle clearance for entire route
  segment and acceptable navigation coverage within 22 NM of a VOR.

- MRA: minimum altitude at which an intersection can be determined.
  - Note: this is usually based on not having DME capability.
