Acronyms and Short Hand Used in Document
----------------------------------------

- comm: communication.
- ESA: emergency safe altitude.
- IAF: initial approach fix.
- IAP: instrument approach procedure.
- MCA: minimum crossing altitude.
- MEA: minimum en route altitude.
- MOCA: minimum obstacle clearance altitude.
- MRA: minimum reception altitude.

Required Equipment for Night Flight
===================================

TH-57 NATOPS 4.21:

1. All instrument and circuit breaker panel lights.
2. All exterior lights.
3. Operable communication radio.
4. Attitude gyro.
5. radar altimeter.

Electrical System Malfunctions While IMC
========================================

FAR 91.187:

- Shall report to ATC any malfunctions of navigational, approach, or comm
  equipment occurring in flight.
- Report shall include:
  1. aircraft identification;
  2. equipment affected;
  3. degree to which IFR operations are impaired;
  4. nature and extent of assistance desired.


Flight Control Malfunctions While IMC
=====================================

- Failures that affect required equipment for IMC flight:
  - Force trim
  - MINISTAB pitch and roll
- For either of the above:
  - if VMC, remain VMC;
  - squawk emergency if necessary (e.g. to deviate from going into IMC);
  - work NATOPS emergency procedures as applicable;
  - notify ATC.


En-Route/Feeder Routes
======================

AIM 5-4-6:

- feeder route:
  - provides transition from en route structure to appropriate IAF.
  - When cleared for the approach, the published off airway (feeder) routes that
    lead from the en route structure to the IAF **are** part of the approach
    clearance.
  - Unless otherwise instructed, once on the feeder route, the pilot may descent
    to the published altitude.

Minimum Safe Altitudes/Emergency Safe Altitudes
===============================================

Pilot Controller Glossary; GP:

- MSA:
  - used for emergency purposes and published on IAPs.
  - at least 1000 ft of obstacle clearance within a 25 mile radius of the
    nav facility, waypoint, or airport reference point used as the MSA center.
  - does not ensure acceptable navigation signal coverage.

- ESA:
  - used for emergency purposes, normally published only in military IAPs.
  - at least 1000' obstacle clearance in non-mountainous areas.
  - at least 2000' obstacle clearance in mountainous areas.
  - within 100 mile radius of nav facility or waypoint used as the ESA center.

MOCA/MCA/MRA
============

Pilot Controller Glossary; GP:

- MCA: lowest altitude at certain fixes at which an aircraft must cross when
  going from a lower to a higher MEA.

- MOCA: lowest altitude which ensures obstacle clearance for entire route
  segment and acceptable navigation coverage within 22 NM of a VOR.

- MRA: minimum altitude at which an intersection can be determined.
  - Note: this is usually based on not having DME capability.

DD 175 and DD 175-1
===================

DD-175
------

- GP Chapter 4.

CNAF_M 3710.7 4.5:

- A flight plan appropriate for the intended operation shall be submitted to the
  local ATC facility for all flights of naval aircraft except the following:
  1. Flights of operational necessity.
  2. CNATRA student training flights within authorized training areas.
- A daily schedule containing an approved stereo (ARTCC computer stored)/canned
  flight plan code may be used in lieu of a DD-175 for other than local flights.
- For VFR flights within the local flying area, the term “local” may be entered
  as route of flight.
- FAA form 7233-1, may be filed in lieu of a DD-175 at US airfields where a
  military base operations is unavailable.
  - Note: DUAT shall not be used to file a flight plan to military destinations.

DD-175-1
--------

CNAF_M 3710.7 4.8.3.2:

- Naval aviators shall request a DD-175-1 flight route weather brief from a DoD
  qualified forecaster whenever a DD-175 flight plan is filed.
- Valid for 3.0 hours past briefing/FWB delivery time or ETD plus one-half hour.
- Should request at least 1 hour prior to proposed brief time for sufficient
  preparation time.
- For IMC flights within a field’s defined local area covered by a canned local
  area/route weather brief, a CR may be used for filing a DD-175 IFR flight plan
  as allowed by local instruction
