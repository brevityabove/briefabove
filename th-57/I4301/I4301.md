   flight instruments must operate satisfactorily.

b. The aircraft shall be equipped with the following in proper operating
   condition:
  1. Airspeed indicator;
  2. Altimeter;
  3. Turn-and-slip indicator;
  4. Clock displaying hours, minutes, and seconds with a sweep-second pointer
     or digital readout;
  5. Attitude indicator;
  6. Magnetic compass with current calibration card;
  7. Heading indicator or gyrostabilized magnetic compass;
