of operational necessity. The pilot shall ensure that ATC is advised of any
limitations of the pilotâ€™s aircraft and equipment that will necessitate special
handling.

a. The pitot heater and all vacuum pressure or electrical sources for the pilot
   flight instruments must operate satisfactorily.

b. The aircraft shall be equipped with the following in proper operating
   condition:
  1. Airspeed indicator;
  2. Altimeter;
  3. Turn-and-slip indicator;
  4. Clock displaying hours, minutes, and seconds with a sweep-second pointer
     or digital readout;
  5. Attitude indicator;
  6. Magnetic compass with current calibration card;
  7. Heading indicator or gyrostabilized magnetic compass;
  8. Vertical speed indicator.

c. Aircraft shall be equipped with deicing or icing control equipment for
   sustained or continuous flight in known or forecast icing conditions.

d. Navigation lights must operate satisfactorily.
