Icing
=====

Reporting Types and Intensity
-----------------------------

Types (AIM 7-1-21; FIH C.17.b.(4)):

-   Glaze (clear): Glossy, clear or translucent ice formed by relatively slow
    freezing of large supercooled water droplets.

-   Rime: Rough, milky, opaque ice formed by instantaneous freezing of small
    supercooled water droplets.

-   Mixed: Simultaneous appearance or combination of rime and glaze (clear) ice
    characteristics.

Intensity (AIM 7-1-20; FIH C.17.b.(4)):

-   Trace: Ice becomes perceptible. Non-hazardous even without use of deicing/
    anti-icing unless encountered &gt; 1 hr.

-   Light: Ice becomes problematic if encountered &gt; 1 hr. Occasional use of
    deicing/anti-icing removes/prevents accumulation.

-   Moderate: Short encounters are problematic. Use of deicing/anti-icing or
    diversion is necessary.

-   Severe: Deicing/anti-icing fails to control the hazard. Immediate diversion
    is necessary.

CNAF
----

-   Flights shall be planned to circumvent areas of forecast atmospheric icing and thunderstorm conditions whenever practicable.

FAR
---

-   Takeoff prohibited with frost, ice, or snow adhering to rotor blade, windshield, stabilizing or control surface, power-plant installation, wing; or to an airspeed, altimeter, rate of climb, attitude system.

-   Takeoff prohibited anytime ice, frost, or snow is expected to adhere to aircraft unless:

    -   Pre-takeoff contamination check within 5 min of takeoff.

    -   Approved alternative procedure to ensure aircraft is free of frost, ice, or snow.

    -   Approved deicing/anti-icing program that complies with 121.629(c).

-   Helicopter flight prohibited under IFR into known or forecast icing conditions or VFR into known icing conditions unless certified and appropriately equipped for operations in icing conditions.
