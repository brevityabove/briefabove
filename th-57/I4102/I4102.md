Icing
=====

Reporting Types and Intensity
-----------------------------

Types (AIM 7-1-21; FIH C.17.b.(4)):

-   Glaze (clear): Glossy, clear or translucent ice formed by relatively slow
    freezing of large supercooled water droplets.

-   Rime: Rough, milky, opaque ice formed by instantaneous freezing of small
    supercooled water droplets.

-   Mixed: Simultaneous appearance or combination of rime and glaze (clear) ice
    characteristics.

Intensity (AIM 7-1-20; FIH C.17.b.(4)):

-   Trace: Ice becomes perceptible. Non-hazardous even without use of deicing/
    anti-icing unless encountered &gt; 1 hr.

-   Light: Ice becomes problematic if encountered &gt; 1 hr. Occasional use of
    deicing/anti-icing removes/prevents accumulation.

-   Moderate: Short encounters are problematic. Use of deicing/anti-icing or
    diversion is necessary.

-   Severe: Deicing/anti-icing fails to control the hazard. Immediate diversion
    is necessary.

CNAF
----

-   Flights shall be planned to circumvent areas of forecast atmospheric icing
    and thunderstorm conditions whenever practicable.

FAR
---

-   Takeoff prohibited with frost, ice, or snow adhering to rotor blade,
    windshield, stabilizing or control surface, power-plant installation,
    wing; or to an airspeed, altimeter, rate of climb, attitude system.

-   Takeoff prohibited anytime ice, frost, or snow is expected to adhere to
    aircraft unless:

    -   Pre-takeoff contamination check within 5 min of takeoff.

    -   Approved alternative procedure to ensure aircraft is free of frost, ice,
        or snow.

    -   Approved deicing/anti-icing program that complies with 121.629(c).

-   Helicopter flight prohibited under IFR into known or forecast icing
    conditions or VFR into known icing conditions unless certified and
    appropriately equipped for operations in icing conditions.
    AIM
    ---

    -   Pilot can expect icing when flying in visible precipitation between +2
        to -10 C.

    -   Takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce lifting power of some aircraft by
        50%.

Icing Emergency Procedure
-------------------------

Operation of the engine during icing conditions could result in ice formations
on the compressor front support. If ice were allowed to build up, airflow to the
engine would be affected and engine performance decreased. Every effort must be
made to remain clear of known icing conditions. The anti-ice system in this
helicopter is to be used as a preventative measure only. Once ice has
accumulated, the anti-ice system cannot be used as a corrective measure (will
not deice). Intentional flight in any known icing condition (&lt; 4 C in visible
moisture) is prohibited. For inadvertent flight in icing conditions, proceed as
follows:

Procedures:

1.  ENG ANTI-ICING - ON.

2.  PITOT HEAT switches - HEAT.

3.  -(C)- Alternate static source knob - As required.

4.  Descend or climb to a warmer temperature or vacate clouds/moisture.

If unable to get clear of icing conditions:

5.  Land as soon as possible.
